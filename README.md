A machine learning project predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values)

Feature encoding for categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)

Train/test split for model evaluation

Logistic Regression model for prediction

Evaluation using Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

Dataset

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv)
